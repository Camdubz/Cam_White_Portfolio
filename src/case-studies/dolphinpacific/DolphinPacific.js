        <h3>Objective</h3>
        <p>
          Dolphin Pacific, the #1 wholesale supplier of pool supplies in New
          Zealand, faced a transformative journey when Paste & Publish acquired
          them during the Inkled liquidation. The primary objective was to
          enhance brand positioning, drive traffic to retail partners, and
          establish Dolphin Pacific as the trusted pool care information
          provider in Oceania.

        <h2>Challenge & Results</h2>
        <p>
          Embarking on this journey, I delved into qualitative survey data from
          89 pool owners in our target areas (online panel). This data became
          the foundation for creating three distinctive personas that would
          guide our marketing efforts{" "}

            <b>CLICK HERE TO VIEW THE FINDINGS</b>
          </a>
          . The findings were presented in a comprehensive manner, providing
          insights into the preferences and behaviors of our target audience.
          Additionally, a Customer Journey Map (CJM) was meticulously carved
          out, aligning our marketing strategy with the identified personas to
          ensure a seamless and engaging user experience.
        </p>

        <p>
          With personas in mind, I outlined a low-fidelity wireframe,
          incorporating essential UX/CRO elements. The transition to
          high-fidelity Figma design, handled by an in-house Paste & Publish
          designer, aimed at striking the delicate balance between aesthetic
          appeal and seamless user experience. The WordPress-built website,
          chosen for its content marketing tools, underwent rigorous technical
          SEO to achieve an impressive 97 performance rating on PageSpeed.
        </p>

        <p>
          Establishing a measurement marketing strategy using GTM, Looker, and
          UA, I ensured that we could effectively track and analyze key content
          metrics. This strategic approach allowed us to gain valuable insights
          into the impact of our marketing initiatives.
        </p>

        <p>
          The core of our marketing strategy revolved around leveraging a
          well-known pool care YouTube channel in the USA. This translated into
          an integrated marketing communications document, breaking down the
          strategy into various channels, content types, and funnel stages. From
          blog articles to downloadable guides, videos, retargeting ads, email
          flows, and even a comprehensive course, every element aimed at
          creating a cohesive and engaging customer journey.
        </p>

        <p>
          My involvement extended to researching, briefing, and publishing every
          article on Dolphin Pacific’s blog. I also took charge of crafting
          downloadable guides and planning their repurposing into different
          video formats. The initiation of a retargeting campaign, offering
          downloadables in exchange for emails, aimed at building a valuable
          subscriber base. The blog content was seamlessly repurposed into email
          flows, employing segmentation based on audience interests and
          collaborating with Salesforce for execution.
        </p>

        <p>
          Regrettably, as my contract with Paste & Publish concluded, external
          pressures from retail partners led to the premature termination of
          Dolphin Pacific's marketing initiatives. This unfortunate decision
          interrupted the momentum of our strategy, leaving untapped potential
          to deliver significant value to pool owners and elevate supplier
          sales. Regardless, Dolphin Pacific increased their website visitors
          from 1k to 23k visitors per month with an email list of over 2k from
          the funnel.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Dolphin Pacific case exemplifies the intricacies of transforming a
          struggling business through strategic marketing. From persona
          development to the execution of an integrated communications plan,
          each step aimed at reshaping Dolphin Pacific’s identity. The premature
          end serves as a poignant reminder of the challenges involved in
          navigating external pressures, reinforcing the importance of aligning
          marketing efforts with long-term business goals for sustained success.
