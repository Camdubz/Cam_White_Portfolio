        <h2>Challenge & Results</h2>
        <p>
          I dedicated several weeks to comprehending the intricacies of the
          product and brand. In the absence of customer data, I conducted
          thorough competitor research and utilized online resources to extract
          relevant themes. This information served as the foundation for
          crafting two comprehensive marketing personas.
        </p>
        <p>
          Subsequently, I meticulously outlined an Integrated Communications
          Strategy, encompassing seven channels and defining various Key
          Performance Indicators (KPIs). The overarching objective was to
          strategically position Dose & Co. as the premier collagen healthcare
          brand in both Oceania and the USA.{" "}

          Libby possessed visual identity documents from an Auckland designer,
          providing an excellent foundation for the copy. Employing a skilled
          New Zealand-based copywriter, I orchestrated the creation of a
          comprehensive copy communications document for all channels.
        </p>
        <p>
          Drawing upon the personas and her unique research methodology, Emily
          successfully crafted a seamless product-message fit. In the
          development of the high-fidelity wireframe using Figma, I integrated
          both the branding documents and my UX Research.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          {" "}
          Prior to the website development, I invested 50 hours in UX research,
          aiming to address both quantitative and qualitative inquiries.
          Quantitative questions included optimizing the customer purchase
          process, maximizing Average Order Value (AOV), and enhancing
          conversion rates.
        </p>
        <p>
          Qualitative aspects involved understanding the motivations behind
          collagen product purchases and identifying pain points experienced by
          collagen customers. Synthesizing this research, I constructed a
          Customer Journey Map (CJM) delineating the anticipated steps, thoughts
          and feelings when purchasing a Dose & Co. product.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          {" "}
          I applied the insights gained from the research while constructing the
          high-fidelity wireframe in Figma, emphasizing a harmonious balance
          between UX research elements and the modern UI branding. Although the
          UI design has undergone changes since the launch, the UX research
          elements I integrated continue to be utilized by Dose & Co. as of this
          update in 2024.

          This includes the implementation of the Reviews.io API for customer
          reviews. While we initially began with YOTPO, dissatisfaction with the
          cost and feature pricing prompted me to dedicate considerable time to
          identify the optimal social proof management platform, ultimately
          securing the best solution at a reasonable price.{" "}

          Considering SEO and media buying perspectives, Google has a sanctioned
          syndication list for reviewing platforms. Thus, identifying an app
          compliant with this requirement, along with considerations for schema
          markup, video and photo reviews, surveys, referrals, and Q&A, posed a
          challenge.
        </p>
        <p>
          The emphasis on locating a robust review platform stemmed from a
          significant UX research finding: social proof plays a pivotal role.
          Consequently, my focus during the initial phase was on garnering as
          many reviews as possible through incentivization, resulting in the
          achievement of over 2,000 reviews within the first three months.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          {" "}
          An additional crucial UX element was the subscription functionality,
          seamlessly integrated through Recharge. Following the approval of the
          wireframe and elements, I proceeded to develop a custom theme in
          Shopify. To ensure a smooth user experience I conducted five user
          tests to identify and address friction points and bugs related to the
          widgets.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upon completion of the website I undertook technical and on-page SEO
          optimizations. Simultaneously, I configured Universal Analytics for
          macro and micro conversion tracking using Google Tag Manager (GTM),
          with data reported through custom-built reports in Google Data Studio.
          Subsequently, I transitioned to the setup and optimization of
          acquisition channels.{" "}

          The initial Integrated Marketing Communications strategy for Dose &
          Co. incorporated various channels, including SEO, Influencer
          Marketing, Press Releases, SERO (Search Engine Relationship
          Optimization), Google Ads, Email Marketing, and Retargeting. I
          established and oversaw the SEO campaign utilizing SEMrush to identify
          opportunities for technical, on-page, and off-page SEO enhancements.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our approach commenced with the creation of collagen recipe content in
          alignment with UX research findings, with a significant focus on
          meeting the criteria for high-ranking Ecommerce product pages, such as
          incorporating reviews, relevant keywords, FAQs, and social signals.{" "}

          The PR campaign, executed by an Auckland-based agency, successfully
          secured articles on prominent news publishers and blogs. Recognizing a
          substantial opportunity for Domain Authority (DA) growth, I took
          proactive measures to contact each editor and blogger, requesting a DF
          (Do Follow) link to ensure the passage of link equity to the Dose &
          Co. website.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, I proposed content partnerships to syndicate and publish
          our SEO content, employing an advanced SEO tactic I term "Search
          Engine Relationship Optimization" (SERO), a strategy for sustained
          content syndication that provides robust brand signals to Googleâ€”an
          often underestimated but crucial facet of SEO.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over a span of 6 months, my SEO efforts propelled Dose & Co. to the
          top of Search Engine Results Pages (SERPs) for all target keywords,
          including "Collagen" for New Zealand and Australia, while securing a
          position within the top 7 SERP results for the United States. Notably,
          9 months post-launch, my SEO campaigns attribution calculations
          indicated a revenue of 4 million New Zealand dollars.{" "}

          Libby already had a substantial social media presence of 27k
          followers, our influencer campaign gained momentum from the start.
          Collaboratively, we curated a targeted list of influencers,
          emphasizing micro-influencers whose impact extended beyond direct
          features on the Dose & Co. Instagram, proving to be a pivotal growth
          lever.
        </p>
        <p>
          Notably, over 60% of Dose & Co. digital sales within the initial 12
          months were attributed to Instagram, showcasing Libby's adept
          networking skills within the influencer community. Employing discount
          codes to track and attribute sales accurately, we compensated
          freelancers with a mix of free products and monetary rewards based on
          audience size and quality.
        </p>
        <p>
          Though my initial involvement in the influencer campaign was limited,
          I gleaned invaluable insights into the effectiveness of social media
          influencer partnerships, particularly when complemented by press and
          digital syndication for comprehensive brand promotion.{" "}

          I orchestrated a robust media buying strategy, spearheading the
          implementation of Google text ads with targeted clusters of
          high-converting keywords and brand terms.

          Expanding our reach, I executed retargeting on Facebook and Instagram
          using email lists and cookies. Employing Klaviyo for the Remarketing
          campaign, I integrated advanced cart/prospect recovery automations,
          SMS marketing, welcome flows, newsletter flows, and content flows.

          Our email marketing initiatives, contributing to one million in sales,
          demonstrated a noteworthy 60% last touchpoint after 12 months. The
          incentivized referral campaign, powered by ReferralCandy API, offered
          a compelling 30% discount for successful referrals and achieved a
          viral coefficient of 1.3, propelling Dose & Co. into exponential
          growth status and solidifying our #1 brand positioning.{" "}

          Within a mere 18 months of inception, Dose & Co. achieved seven-figure
          revenue and garnered significant attention, ultimately securing
          acquisition by a venture capital firm in an equity partnership with
          Khloe Kardashian.

        <p>
          Despite the notable celebrity partnership, I contend that Dose & Co.
          had already established itself as the premier Collagen Healthcare
          brand, successfully attaining the initial goal set forth by the
          Integrated Marketing Communications (IMC) campaign. Throughout this
          journey, I gained invaluable insights and contributed significantly to
          Dose & Co.'s success, underscoring the pivotal role of my involvement

          Prior to the handover, my goal was to refine the customer feedback
          loop by implementing qualitative feedback analysis, deploying surveys
          at various points in the customer journey, and combining these
          insights with quantitative data. The objective was to optimize sales,
          improve customer retention, elevate NPS and CSAT, all while
          considering UX and CRO KPIs. Alongside this, I aimed to scale media
          buying channels and integrate additional channels and CJS
