          <h3>Objective</h3>
          <p>
            I played a pivotal role as the head marketing consultant for SOHL's
            ambitious venture into the wellness market with the launch of their
            Red Light Therapy products. Tasked as part of the Whealth projects,
            my mission was to develop a comprehensive marketing strategy that
            would position SOHL as the premier brand in the global Red Light
            Therapy space.

          <h2>Challenge & Results</h2>
          <p>
            My journey began with an in-depth competitor research phase,
            analyzing various marketing tactics and strategies, even exploring
            different verticals due to market. I spent over 2 months meeting
            with the founders (Tahnee and Matt) to understand everything about
            the product and positioning. Combining this with my own UX research,
            I crafted a low-fidelity wireframe that laid the foundation for the
            upcoming campaign.
          </p>

          <p>
            Collaborating with branding expert Rachel Rennie, I implemented the
            copy document from a Rachel Rennie Brand Bible - Rachel is a friend
            of mine so I had a lot of fun working with her and Emily on this
            project. The visual branding took a lot of back-and-forth sifting
            through local and international designers until Tahnee (Brand
            Manager) was happy. 
            </p>
            <p>
            
            The end result was a contemporary visual
            identity document that would make Apple and Equinox proud. In
            addition to the branding I suggested using 3D models instead of
            product photography. I spent 30 hours working with a 3D
            hyper-realistic blender designer to make the product graphics saving
            thousands on product photography.
          </p>

          <p>
            I developed a 25-page Integrated Marketing Communications strategy,
            setting the groundwork for the brand's launch. To ensure seamless
            collaboration and task management, I worked with a local Microsoft
            Teams expert to implement an automated system, aligning the
            marketing team cohesively towards our goals.
          </p>

          <p>
            Identifying two key personas—a 50-year-old man seeking health stack
            additions and a trend-following 30-year-old individual—I tailored
            our marketing strategies to resonate with these segments, keeping a
            focused approach for maximum impact.
          </p>

          <p>
            Crafting an influencer campaign, I researched 20 macro influencers
            on major social media channels, even exploring a potential
            collaboration with celebrities such as Sam Cane. Carefully selecting
            affiliates further enhanced our strategy, especially for
            higher-priced products.
          </p>

          <p>
            Conducting extensive keyword research (50,000 keywords), I clustered
            them into themes to inform our content marketing strategy. Technical
            SEO on our custom Shopify theme and meticulous on-page SEO
            optimization aimed to secure visibility for our top-level keywords.
          </p>

          <p>
            I implemented a robust measurement marketing stack comprising Google
            Tag Manager, Looker, GA4, and Sheets, ensuring a unified and
            accurate source of data for insights and optimizations.
          </p>

          <p>
            Visualizing a content marketing machine, I integrated it seamlessly
            with influencer marketing, remarketing, retargeting and PR. The goal
            was to establish a consistent stream of sales and position SOHL for
            success in the competitive Red Light Therapy market.
          </p>

          <p>
            I created SOPs for carrying out the campaign which included briefing
            articles, using AI+Editors for writing, scheduling and publishing,
            syndicating to publishers, script creation, storyboarding, freelance
            video editors, social media syndication, social media content,
            automated video scheduling, short vs long videos, influencers, PR
            agency selection and management, influencer management, remarketing,
            retargeting and measurement.
          </p>

          <p>
            Establishing Standard Operating Procedures for every aspect of the
            campaign, I integrated the entire workflow into Microsoft Teams.
            Through training, I ensured the team was adept at using the
            workflow, guaranteeing continued success even after my contract
            ended.
          </p>

          <p>
            Despite the initial setback of Sam Cane declining the launch
            campaign partnership, the strategies implemented have propelled SOHL
            to success. Positive recognition, including a review from Sam Cane
            on the website, reflects the brand's standing in the competitive Red
            Light Therapy market. The meticulous planning and execution have
            positioned SOHL as a prominent player, achieving product-market fit
            within identified segments.
