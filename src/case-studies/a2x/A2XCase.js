          <h2>Challenge & Results</h2>
          <p>
            A2X is an ecommerce accounting app that helps businesses,
            accountants, and bookkeepers, automatically reconcile payouts from
            their sales channels in QuickBooks Online, Xero, or Sage.
          </p>

          <p>
            After some market research A2X found an opportunity to reach
            prospective customers when they are starting their Ecommerce
            business, and continue to provide value to support them on their
            journey.
          </p>

          <p>
            I started with a comprehensive analysis of their current
            communications strategy and customer funnels to see whether there
            are gaps that could affect the SEO campaign success.
          </p>

          <p>
            I then conducted keyword research using seed keywords I gathered in
            my initial consultation with the content marketing director and
            analysis of their new audience personas.
          </p>

          <p>
            Using a proprietary process I successfully clustered 70,000 keywords
            into large overarching cohorts (top-level categories).
          </p>

          <p>
            I filtered the cohorts further until I had approximately 1,400
            clusters with an average of 1,000 searches per month. With the
            clusters ready I moved on to briefing.
          </p>

          <p>
            Using Trello I created detailed briefs for the writing team which
            included a proprietary writing process template, the goal of the
            article, recommended supplementary content (video, downloadable,
            tool, infographic, Ebook, whitepaper...), and indications of the
            illustrations required.
          </p>

          <p>
            As the articles were published I consulted with the data team to
            ensure their data gathering and reporting was set up in line with my
            measurement marketing methodology.
          </p>

          <p>
            Success was measured using attribution modeling as well as micro
            conversion metrics such as time on page, scroll % and email
            conversion. We also tracked SEO metrics such as Domain Authority
            (DA), organic traffic conversions, organic traffic and search
            visibility.
          </p>

          <p>
            At the time of my contract ending the campaign was an irrefutable
            success. A2X increased traffic by approximately 40% resulting in a
            large uplift in app sign-ups and revenue.
          </p>

          <p>
            The ultimate goal of taking hold of the Ecommerce digital segment
            was met.
